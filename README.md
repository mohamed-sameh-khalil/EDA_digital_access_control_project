# EDA_digital_access_control_project
This was an elecronic design automation I did in my junior year it was a digital lock for a door using VHDL.

One of the tasks for the project was to create a VHDL testbench to be sure everything on the simulation level is working as expected.

I used modelsim to simulate the hardware using VHDl. I then used fedora linux distro to go through with synthesis and optimization steps Those included ( FSM synthesis, Netlist optimization, Delay Simulation,  Scan-path insertion, Floorplanning,Placement,Routing,Post-Layout Verification)
